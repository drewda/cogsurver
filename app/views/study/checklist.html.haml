      %p Now you finally have the chance to view all the data that you've contributed over the past week. The Cognitive Surveyor Explorer works best in the latest version of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="http://chrome.google.com/">Google Chrome</a>. Please make sure you are using one of those Web browsers before opening the Explorer and completing the following three tasks:
      %ol
        - if current_user.landmarks.where(:familiarity_rating => nil).length == 0      
          %li.checked Rate your familiarity with each of your landmarks (there will be instructions on how to do this).
        - else
          %li Rate your familiarity with each of your landmarks (there will be instructions on how to do this).
        %li Check to make sure that your landmarks are named correctly and are in the appropriate locations. Please rename or move them if necessary.
        %li Take as long as you'd like to explore your results.
      %li= link_to "To complete these three tasks, open Cognitive Surveyor Explorer", viewer_main_path
        
      %p After you are finished exploring your results, please complete a final questionnaire.
